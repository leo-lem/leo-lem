<summary><strong>Engineering Profile</strong></summary>

I am a backend-oriented software engineer with a focus on building reliable, maintainable systems. My work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, early architecture decisions, and DevOps, with an emphasis on pragmatic tradeoffs rather than overengineering.

I am comfortable working across different stacks and languages, including Swift, TypeScript, Python, and Java, and I adapt quickly to new technologies when the product requires it. I care about clean system boundaries, operational simplicity, and developer experience.

I enjoy environments with high ownership and low process, where engineering is closely connected to product decisions. I prefer teams that value clarity, collaboration, and long-term maintainability over short-term hacks.

I am currently completing a Master’s degree in Computer Science after transitioning from an Economics background, and I am exploring product-focused engineering roles at small to mid-sized teams.
